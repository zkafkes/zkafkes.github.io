  <h1>A Young Professional Applied for Her Dream Job. You Won’t Believe What Happens Next.</h1>
  <p>
    One night, after making a wonderful homemade bolognese pasta sauce for dinner, young professional Zoe Kafkes sat on her couch. Exhausted from a long weekend working at the Atlanta Greek Festival and an equally long day full of planning meetings at the office, she went to check her email. “Explore Canyon Lands,” prompted Chaco—delete. “It’s almost scarf season,” reminded Starbucks—delete. “New job postings,” LinkedIn beckoned—click, scroll, gasp!
  </p>
  <p>
    The dream job flashed across the screen: “MARKETING AND EVENT COORDINATOR II—GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY.”
  </p>
  <p>
    “This is it,” she thought to herself as she immediately texted her friend Seth Furman, graduate student in the very same school the position was with, to tell him how excited she was! She applied to the position as soon as she was able to write her cover letter.
  </p>
  <p>
    The next day, something incredible happened. She heard back about the job—they wanted to bring her in for an interview. She spoke with Bruce Stiftel, the head of the department himself, and he asked her several questions about her background.
  </p>
  <p>
    She told him about her experience in higher education working at the University of Miami. When talking about her professional skills, she highlighted her flexibility, customer service and ability to work well on teams. Once he heard more about her current role as Communications Director and her past at UM, it was evident that she had the communications skills necessary to meet and exceed the school’s needs from her graphic design ability, to her website design and maintenance experience, to her love for copy writing and editing, to her obsession with branding. Then, Mr. Stiftel found out she was a photographer and already had experience photographing events in addition to studying under the talented Maggie Steber. He was almost sold.
  </p>
  <p>
But first, he had some concerns and wanted to dig deeper. He discovered that through her past experiences she had developed the working knowledge of event planning and coordination needed to excel in the position. Even though it was never a part of her specified job responsibilities, she spearheaded a major event to celebrate the Inauguration of UM’s sixth University president from start to finish…and that was just the beginning. He also learned that while she might be young, she had the tenacity and work ethic to gracefully take on the challenges the job would provide.
  </p>
  <p>
    So they hired Zoe Kafkes for her dream job. (But only after they chuckled at this webpage—that she built herself—and checked out the rest of her portfolio!)
  </p>
  <p>
    She goes on to serve the School of City and Regional Planning at Georgia Tech for many years, providing significant support to the school’s marketing efforts, loving every minute of it, and becoming an integral part of the department and team.
