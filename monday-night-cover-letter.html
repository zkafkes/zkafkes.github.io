  <h1>Monday Night Brewing Finds Ideal Candidate for Brand Coordinator Job. You Won’t Believe What They Do Next.</h1>
  <p>
    One Sunday afternoon, young professional Zoe Kafkes met up with a friend. She was exhausted after a Saturday spent drinking beer and watching college football (Go ‘Canes!), but after several cups of coffee, she was ready to go! Her friend dragged her in the pouring rain to Urbantree Cidery. After breaking their Jenga record, Zoe and Dani brought their glasses back up to the bar and began speaking with Jessica, the bartender.
  </p>
  <p>
    They talked about life, which eventually led to talking about jobs. Zoe mentioned how unhappy she was at her present job working as the Communications Director for a religious organization. She mentioned how she wanted to work in an environment where she wasn’t the youngest by more than 40 years, where her bosses wanted to try new things, and whose product made people happy. She told Jessica about her communications background and love for all things PR, graphic design, web management, and media relations. Monday Night Brewing came up.
  </p>
  <p class="big">
BAM. THAT’S WHEN IT HAPPENED. The dream job flashed before Zoe’s eyes: “BRAND COORDINATOR FOR MONDAY NIGHT BREWING.”
  </p>
  <p>
“This is it,” she thought to herself as she immediately thanked Jessica and Dani for giving her the hope she’d been searching for the last few weeks on the job hunt. She put on her thinking cap… Everyone and their mother must be applying to the coolest position to hit LinkedIn since the last time OPI looked for people to name nail polish colors…how could she differentiate herself? How could she catch their attention and really show Monday Night Brewing that she was more than just qualified, but their next team member?  </p>
  <p>
Cover letters are a necessary evil. They are traditional. But traditional isn’t always best. Zoe would know. Her current boss still insisted on sending snail mail when an email or phone call could do the job. But just like she convinced him to start using MailChimp for some of his major correspondence (with her help of course), she thought, “Maybe I can revolutionize the cover letter.”</p>
  <p>
So she submitted this article (conveniently attached to <a href="http://zoekafkes.me/">her portfolio site</a>—that she built herself).</p>
<p>
  The next day, something incredible happened. She heard back about the job—they wanted to bring her in for an interview. They brought her in to talk with her and sit around The Garage to see if she could fit in with the team. She told them about her professional skills, highlighting her “ready for anything” attitude and ability to work well on teams. Once they heard more about her current role as Communications Director and her past roles at the University of Miami and Norwegian Cruise Line, it was evident that she had the communications skills necessary to meet and exceed Monday Night’s needs. With her social media experience, graphic design ability, website design and maintenance skills, her love for copy writing and editing, and her obsession with branding she was near perfect. Then, they found out she was a photographer and already had experience photographing events of all kinds. The only thing that could make her better was the fact that she helped plan several of those events herself.
</p>
<p>
They were almost sold until she told them that her dinosaur trivia wasn’t quite up to par since she focused on her musical theatre obsession instead. Only slightly turned off, they continued to chat and she told them about how at her current position she works on a very small team and helps with whatever needs to be taken care of: meaning she was ready to help in the taproom, with sales, and on the operations side in addition to her marketing, PR and event roles. After all, she believes the best way for a brand to grow is by creating ambassadors from within the company and working together as a team.
</p>
<p>
So they hired Zoe Kafkes <em>right then and there</em> over a nice pint of Drafty Kilt (her personal favorite).
</p>
<p>
She joined the team, growing the brand into a true lifestyle brand through PR, both social and traditional media, events and special programming, all while maintaining branding standards.
</p>
<p>
After her first week on the job, she never looked forward to the weekend again. After all, <em>weekends are overrated.</em>
